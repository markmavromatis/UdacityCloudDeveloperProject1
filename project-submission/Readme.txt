I have uploaded the starter files and tracked my changes via commits in this Github Repo: https://github.com/markmavromatis/UdacityCloudDeveloperProject1

My AWS-hosted website URL: http://mark-udacity-travel-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/index.html
    (or http://d1aoxiyypvn2sb.cloudfront.net/index.html)

Here are the steps and associated screenshots describing how I completed this exercise:

1) Created an S3 bucket called 'mark-udacity-travel-website'
2) Uploaded the static content (with small changes to the title and background image) to the S3 bucket
3) Updated the S3 bucket policy to be publically accessible with GetObject permissions.
4) Updated the S3 settings to support static website hosting.
5) Created a CloudFront distribution to host the website.
6) Tested the website

Screenshots are attached for reference.
